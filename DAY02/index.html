    <p class="description">Salaar (2023) is a high-octane Indian action drama that delivers raw intensity, powerful emotions, and
        larger-than-life storytelling. Directed by Prashanth Neel (of KGF fame), the movie stars Prabhas in a rugged,
        commanding role that reminds fans why he’s known for mass action cinema.

        The story is set in a dark, violent world ruled by power, loyalty, and betrayal. At its core, Salaar explores
        friendship, vengeance, and destiny, showing how past promises and hidden truths shape the future. Prabhas plays
        a fierce yet emotionally layered character whose silence speaks louder than words. The bond between the lead
        characters is one of the strongest elements of the film, giving emotional depth to the brutal action.</p>

        storytelling, intense emotions, and strong character portrayal.

        The story revolves around Pushpa Raj, a daily wage worker who enters the world of red sandalwood smuggling.

        system and authority. The film strongly highlights themes of self-respect, class struggle, ambition, and
